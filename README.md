This project is a simple Java-based Student Management System designed like a mini CMS (Content Management System). It allows managing student data through different roles like Admin and Student. The system supports creating, reading, and updating student records using file handling techniques.

🧑‍🎓 Student Features:

View personal details (name, roll number, marks, etc.)

Read results and stored info from file

🛡️ Admin Features:

Add new student records

Update or overwrite student information

Save records into a file using FileWriter

Read all records from a file using FileReader or BufferedReader

💡 Java Concepts Used:

Classes and Object-Oriented Programming

Arrays and ArrayLists

String manipulation

Exception handling (try-catch & custom messages)

File handling (FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter)

Try-with-resources block for safe file closing

Conditional logic (if-else, switch)

Separation of logic into multiple methods for clean code

🧰 Development Tools:

Java 17+

IntelliJ IDEA

Git for version control

GitHub for collaboration & version history

This project is ideal for beginner-to-intermediate Java learners who want to build a practical console-based system that manages data using files instead of databases.
